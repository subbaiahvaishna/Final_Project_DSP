# Final_Project_DSP
This project analyzes U.S. imports of all commodities using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. I used Python and a Jupyter Notebook along with libraries such as pandas and matplotlib to clean, organize, and visualize the data. The analysis focuses on identifying trends and changes in import levels over time while practicing real-world data analysis skills using government data.
