# Final_Project_DSP
This project analyzes U.S. imports of all commodities using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The purpose of this project is to explore real government data and practice data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python. I used Python and a Jupyter Notebook along with libraries such as pandas and matplotlib to clean, organize, and visualize the data. The analysis focuses on identifying trends and changes in import levels over time.

The files included in this repository are:
- import_all_commodities.xls: the original dataset downloaded from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  
- cleaned_imports.csv: the cleaned version of the dataset used for analysis  
- FinalProj_Milestone2.ipynb: initial data loading and exploration  
- FinalProj_Milestone3.ipynb: data cleaning and transformations  
- FinalProj_Milestone4.ipynb: analysis and visualizations of 2 of the questions
- FinalProject_DSP.ipynb: final combined notebook with full analysis  
- One-Page Summary - DSP Final Project.docx: written summary of the project
